# 2024-Sales-Analysis
----

* ## Project Overview
---
The 2024 Sales analysis is an interactive business intelligence solution built using Excel to analyze transaction-level sales data and deliver actionable insights. The analysis integrates order details, product performance, regional trends, and profitability metrics to support data-driven decision-making.
This project transforms raw sales records into a structured, visual, and insight-driven analytical tool for performance monitoring and strategic planning.

## Problem Statement
 ---
Organizations often struggle with:

	• Fragmented sales data spread across multiple sheets
  
	• Difficulty tracking revenue and profit performance
  
	• Limited visibility into product and regional trends
  
	• Time-consuming manual reporting processes
  
This project addresses these challenges by designing a centralized, automated, and interactive dashboard that provides real-time sales performance insights.


## Objectives
---
The key objectives of this project include:

	1. Organize and clean raw sales transaction data.
  
	2. Calculate financial metrics such as revenue, cost, and profit.
  
	3. Analyze performance by:
		 Product
		 Sales Agent
		 Region
		 Time (Monthly/Quarterly trends)
     
	4. Identify high-performing and underperforming areas.
  
	5. Provide a user-friendly, interactive dashboard for stakeholders.
